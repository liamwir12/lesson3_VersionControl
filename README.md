## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Version control is a logging system that archives any alterations to a file or set of files over a period of time so that you can access them later.)
2. (Inspired by the Linux kernel, an open source software project of a fairly large scope, git is a free open source versioning control system that stores information.)
3. (While most VCS store information as a list of file-based changes, and think of the information they store as a set and the changes made to each file over time, Git differs in the sense that when you commit, the file’s state is recorded similarly to taking a screenshot on your phone.)
4. (Typically, you can gain a Git repository by taking a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or duplicate an existing Git repository from somewhere else.)
5. (If the user needs a copy of an existing Git repository the command they would need to type is “git clone”.)
